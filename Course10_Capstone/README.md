# Introduction

This is the tenth course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization, **Data Science Capstone**. This course focuses on analyzing a large corpus of text documents to discover the structure in the data and how words are put together to build a predictive text model.

# Contents
### Task 1: Getting and cleaning the data
 - Tokenization: identifying appropriate tokens such as words, punctuation, and numbers. Writing a function that takes a file as input and returns a tokenized version of it.

### Task 2: Exploratory data analysis
 - Exploratory analysis - perform a thorough exploratory analysis of the data, understanding the distribution of words and relationship between the words in the corpora.
 - Understand frequencies of words and word pairs - build figures and tables to understand variation in the frequencies of words and word pairs in the data.
